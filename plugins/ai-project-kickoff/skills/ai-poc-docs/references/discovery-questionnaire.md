# Discovery / requirements-gathering questionnaire

These are **topics to cover**, not a script. The elicitation **style is flexible** — ask one focused question at a time, or in small grouped batches, as the engineer prefers. Whichever style, **capture each agreed point into the relevant `docs/` markdown file in the same turn** (see `gate-taxonomy.md`); the working markdown — not a one-off questionnaire — is the durable record. Reflect answers back, record assumptions and open questions, probe where answers are vague, and never assume.

## A. Project identity
- Project name; a short **document code** (3–5 letters) used as `<CODE>` in all document codes and file names.
- One-line description; sponsor; owners and their roles; reviewers.

## B. Business context
- The business problem and its drivers; the current-state process and its pain points; the desired future state; the measurable benefits sought.

## C. Scope & phasing
- In scope and out of scope; what the PoC specifically covers; intended later phases.

## D. AI solution approach
- What the AI does; where it assists versus where deterministic logic or humans decide; the proposed architecture/pipeline and its stages; the human-in-the-loop checkpoints; any reuse of existing solutions or data.

## E. Technology & hosting
- Languages and frameworks; cloud platform and services; model(s) and how they are invoked; hosting/compute choice; integration points and external systems/APIs.

## F. Data
- Inputs and outputs; formats and sources; volumes; sensitivity and any personal data; retention; whether any data is used for model training; lawful basis if relevant.

## G. Constraints & non-functional requirements
- Accuracy/quality targets; latency; security and identity; scalability; compliance considerations (ISO/IEC 42001, NIST AI RMF, UK GDPR / EU AI Act applicability); auditability.

## H. Validation
- How outputs are validated; acceptance criteria; availability of a golden/evaluation dataset; sign-off authorities.

## I. Delivery
- Timeline and milestones; budget/resourcing; key risks, assumptions and dependencies.

## J. Materials & brand assets
- Any existing discovery materials (transcripts, minutes, notes, prior specs) — request them.
- Confirm the brand logo (`tecman_logo.png`) and the Tecman style are available. If missing, request them before producing documents.

## Closing the discovery
Present: (i) a concise requirements summary; (ii) the proposed PoC document list with recommended additions/omissions and reasons; (iii) the project `<CODE>`; (iv) the applicable standards from `standards.md`. Obtain explicit go-ahead before generating any document.
